      "\"9\" is an animated film that fits the dark and moody sci-fi genre. It presents a post-apocalyptic world where sentient dolls, created from the remnants of humanity, struggle for survival against machines that have wiped out civilization. The film's atmosphere is filled with tension, isolation, and existential themes, similar to \"Alien.\" Both films explore the fragility of life and the consequences of humanity's actions, making \"9\" a compelling choice for fans of dark sci-fi.\n",

      "While the other films listed do not primarily fall into the sci-fi genre, \"9\" features a distinct visual style that complements its dark themes. The animation is gritty and atmospheric, enhancing the sense of dread and despair that permeates the story. This aligns with the haunting visuals mentioned in the description of \"Alien.\"\n",

      "### Other Films:\n",
      "- **\"Virus\" (1999)** also has elements of horror and sci-fi, featuring a crew battling a malevolent artificial intelligence on a ship. However, it does not achieve the same level of critical acclaim or thematic depth as \"9\" or \"Alien.\"\n",
