      "Plot: When his lightning bolt is stolen, Zeus accuses Poseidon's son Percy Jackson and gives Poseidon's son fourteen days to return it, otherwise he will initiate a war amongst the gods. Meanwhile the teenager, Percy, who is dyslexic and has ADHD is visiting The Museum of Metropolitan of Art and is attacked by a Fury disguised in his teacher. His physically handicapped best friend Grover reveals that Percy is a demigod and that he is his protector and his teacher Mr Brunner gives him a pen telling him that it is a powerful weapon. They go to Percy's house and together with his mother Sally they drive to the Camp Half-Blood. However Sally is attacked by a Minotaur and vanishes before Percy can help her. In the camp, Percy befriends the gorgeous Annabeth; when they are attacked by Hades who wants the lighting bolt for himself, Percy discovers that his mother is in the Underworld with Hades. Percy decides to travel on a dangerous quest to retrieve the lightning bolt and save his mother. Grover and Annabeth join him and Luke gives a powerful shield of his own to protect Percy. Will they be able to succeed?\n",

      "Reviews:\n",
      "Review: Of all the would-be Potter projects that have hit the screen over the years, this is one of more polished and enjoyable ones.\n",
      "Review: A little bit worse than lifeless; it's clueless, like a Medusa running around with her head cut off.\n",
      "Review: An awful lot of acting talent goes to waste in this film, but there is barely enough here to marginally satisfy the younger set.\n",
      "Review: You don't even have to be familiar with the first book in Rick Riordan's popular fantasy series to enjoy Chris Columbus' energetic adaptation.\n",
      "Review: Kids may well enjoy the adventures of The Lightning Thief on screen, but I think most readers will prefer the movie in their imaginations.\n",
      "Review: Action movies of this scale often start off strong and wind down to forgettable finales, but Percy Jackson is the opposite, overcoming a clunky setup to deliver nearly all its thrills in the last half-hour.\n",
      "Review: Enjoyable, nicely paced family adventure with likeable characters, a strong central premise and some decent set-pieces, though the plot's a little hazy in places and the humour doesn't always work.\n",
      "Review: Whether audiences will get behind The Lightning Thief is hard to predict. Overall, it's an entertaining introduction to a promising new world -- but will the consuming shadow of Potter be too big to break free of?\n",
      "Review: Of all the players, Uma Thurman channels the Bride to deliver a Medusa the children won't easily forget when it comes to bedtime.\n",
      "Review: Uma Thurman demonstrates she can wear a snake-covered head as gracefully as Pierce Brosnan can trot around with a horse's netherlands.\n",
      "Review: The disappearance of lightning simply is not interesting, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians sounds more like a '70s funk band than a kid's series.\n",
      "Review: Even with all its computer-generated fireballs, it's lukewarm medium-budget blockbustering.\n",
      "Review: Chris Columbus and his crew take a literal approach to spectacle that denies the magnificent use of weirdness and scale that famed stop-action animator Ray Harryhausen brought to such myth-inspired classics as \"Jason and the Argonauts\" (1963)...\n",
      "Review: The Lightning Thief isn't electric, but it generates some spark when it varies the Grecian formula.\n",
      "Review: Columbus aims at nothing more than providing a rambunctious romp. He nimbly avoids the fate that has snared other film adaptations, like Eragon and Inkheart.\n",
      "Review: The Greek-gods premise lets the filmmakers indulge in some visually whizzy sequences that keep this rather lightweight action movie entertaining.\n",
      "Review: What's really lacking in The Lightning Thief is a genuine sense of wonder, the same thing that brings viewers back to Hogwarts over and over again.\n",
      "Review: It's more a list of ingredients than a movie-magic potion to enjoy from start to finish.\n",
      "Review: Harry Potter knockoffs don't come more transparent and slapdash than this wannabe-franchise jumpstarter directed by Chris Columbus.\n",
      "Review: Although the standard allegorical bases for mythical-quest movies are dutifully covered, the obvious similarity of Percy Jackson to the Harry Potter movies inevitably makes it feel somewhat secondhand.\n",
      "Review: Imperfect, yes, but also both suitably imaginative and entertaining. Works as action-adventure razzle-dazzle, coming-of-age tale, and beginners' lesson on Greek mythology.\n",
      "Review: When the movie slows down to catch its breath, there's very little of the heart and soul -- and wry wit -- that make the Riordan books so beloved.\n",
      "Review: The main thing this movie seems to be missing is classically trained British actors.\n",
      "Review: Admirably, the movie isn't bogged down in the exposition common to first entries, but at the end, it's a franchise searching for its voice.\n",
      "Review: [P]erfectly inoffensive, occasionally clever... It's in the few genuinely cinematically joyful moments, the ones that do rise above the formula, that you realize how much more this could have been...\n",
      "Review: Percy Jackson may not be \"Harry Potter good,\" but kids will really enjoy it and parents will be happy to have a moviethey can bring them to that's family-friendly.\n",
      "Review: This cast is simply too generic. None of the young thespians stick out.\n",
      "Review: The best thing you can say about Chris Columbus's adaptation is that he's incapable of destroying whatever magic and wonder it is in these books that has kept kids coming back for more.\n",
      "Review: Chris Columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless, episodic fantasy saga based on the young-reader book series by Rick Riordan.\n",
      "Review: For what it is and for whom it is intended, it's not a bad movie, just an indifferent one.\n",
      "Review: This action-packed fantasy adventure, based on Rick Riordan's hit Percy Jackson and the Olympians series of books, is great fun, and deserves to find an audience with teens now bereft of any Harry Potter magic.\n",
      "Review: Crammed with dragons, set-destroying fights and things exploding, [Columbus] squeezes in a few well-meaning pause breaks about friendship and absent fathers before swiftly moving on to the next pyrotechnics display.\n",
      "Review: Fun, brisk and imaginative\n",
      "Review: Percy Jackson isn't a great movie, but it's a good one, trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references.\n",
      "Review: The Lightning Thief makes the idea of a sequel seem like an inviting proposition.\n",
      "Review: In Columbus' hands, it once again all breaks down into a series of rushed, breathless special-effects setpieces, in a thrill ride that isn't headed anywhere new.\n",
      "Review: The movie feels like a cut-rate Potter knockoff with a dash of Ray Harryhausen.\n",
      "Review: Percy Jackson & the Olympians sounds like an Otis Redding cover band. It is, instead, an unofficial cover of the Harry Potter franchise.\n",
      "Review: Kids will love it, and adults may relish Pierce Brosnan's Centaur, and Steve Coogan as Hades - in his personal hell just under Hollywood.\n",
      "Review: It's not enough to compensate for the computer-game-style plotting, which is largely based on us picking up narrative nuggets that mechanically slot into place later on.\n",
      "Review: An imaginative, if simplistic, visit to classical Greek mythology, an archetypal quest by a lad with paternal issues.\n",
      "Review: Chris Columbus was a safe choice behind the lens, and he doesn't throw up any surprises. Columbus brings a measured approach that works on the whole, delivering the expected mix of set-ups, set-pieces and edge of your seat showdowns.\n",
      "Review: Percy Jackson & the Olympians is a dutifully made kids' fantasy film that Columbus handles with the basic approach that he wielded on his faithful but vanilla Harry Potter adaptations.\n",
      "Review: there's not one single thing in it that will appeal to a person who has ever seen a mythological origin story before, much less any other sort of adventure movie.\n",
      "Review: So trite and ludicrous it is no threat to the Harry Potter franchise\n",
      "Review: ...an attempt to replicate the phenomenon that is Harry Potter.\n",
      "Review: The film is a rousing blend of special effects, but not so scary that children aged seven and above will spend the entire movie hiding behind their fingers.\n",
      "Review: A slab of market research in search of an actual movie.\n",
      "Review: Maybe if you're aged between eight and 12, or exceptionally dim-witted, you may not notice that this is a tenth-rate rip-off of Harry Potter, with Greek mythology taking the place of magic.\n",
      "Review: The story is told in bland, episodic fashion with no sense of drama or threat.\n",
      "Review: It's fantastic fun, it knows its Greek mythology, and it's a very promising start to a franchise. More of the same, please.\n",
      "Review: This ineffably wooden Chris Columbus adaptation of author Rick Riordan's best-seller for young teens has a screenplay that defies description.\n",
      "Review: The technical wizardry is spectacular and the story is taut, pacy and consistently inventive.\n",
      "Review: The tone is not always certain, but the special effects are as spectacular as and the mythological underpinning more compelling than anything in the Harry Potter series.\n",
      "Review: The Lightning Thief is all crass ineptitude and lost potential. Columbus' infantilizing of any character depth and use of leftover Harry Potter special effects will amuse only the smallest in your pantheon.\n",
      "Review: Very American, very crass and very underwhelming.\n",
      "Review: Not bad, but JK Rowling can rest easy.\n",
      "Review: While this might not rival the later, better Harry Potter movies or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it's more fun than you might expect.\n",
      "Review: Columbus directs with his usual frying pan to the head. Music is forever swelling majestically. Characters are always opening wide their eyes and mouths to gaze in wonder.\n",
      "Review: With great effects (and a few surprises) it's a fun, Saturday-matinee adventure.\n",
      "Review: An attempt to steal some of Harry Potter's thunder that also stands on its own as a well-made large-scale adventure that works well enough to entertain the teens it's hoping to strike.\n",
      "Review: This is generic filmmaking at its most banal, a simple-minded simplification of a not overwhelmingly complex book.\n",
      "Review: With a top-notch cast and dazzling special effects, this will tide the teens over until the next Harry Potter instalment.\n",
      "Review: Uma Thurman as Medusa, the gorgon with a coiffure of writhing snakes and stone-inducing hypnotic gaze is one of the highlights of this bewitching fantasy\n",
      "Review: I thought it was mischievous and witty and amusing and I was just sort of drawn into it.\n",
      "Review: If they'd played it for laughs it might just have worked, but in fact its earnest tone and digimation effects stick pretty close to the Potter model. We could be in for a very long haul.\n",
      "Review: Digitisation reigns - spectacular visual effects - while the dialogue drizzles and sploshes.\n",
      "Review: It is great to see Greek Mythology taking centre stage, even if people must say \"no way\", \"yes way\" when faced with a fire-breathing hydra.\n",
      "Review: While the Hogwarts saga may be getting long in the tooth, at least it has decent characters and a sense of humour. This has neither.\n",
      "Review: It's evidently Potter-ish, but unashamedly aimed at younger viewers - which makes the emphasis on the junior hero's fighting skills and a clearly misguided Las Vegas casino sequence all the more dismaying.\n",
      "Review: While you suspect it's really just a big Clash Of The Titans spoiler, there's enough action in Jackson to make it succeed on its own terms. Lerman's a likeable lead, though it's the game supporting cast that keeps you watching.\n",
      "Review: There's plenty of larks to be had from a fast-moving fantasy that doesn't take its mythology too seriously and employs actors who don't look like teenage rabbits in headlights.\n",
      "Review: Percy Jackson manages to make Greek mythology both fun and exciting and is sure to appeal to its key demographic.\n",
      "Review: The plot is a pretty blatant rehash of the typical \"coming-of-age hero\" tropes. Still, while \"Percy Jackson\" may not end up being the next huge and successful franchise, at the very least, it was an honest and amusing two hours.\n",
      "Review: gets so many things right that when it goes astray that you kind of wish it hadn't tried in the first place\n",
      "Review: It raises issues it doesn't have the balls to resolve by placing them in a context it doesn't have the brains to exploit.\n",
      "Review: The premise of Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief holds great potential potential the film never realizes.\n",
      "Review: It provides a great adventure movie for the family audience.\n",
      "Review: Grand prize goes to Uma Thurman as snake-headed Medusa. It's also a pleasure to see Steve Coogan in hell.\n",
      "Review: As a former middle school teacher of gifted literature, I value all fairly well-made films for children and parents and this one is in that league.\n",
      "Review: The Lightning Thief is an admirable kid's fantasy.\n",
      "Review: OK, but only just.\n",
      "Review: There's nothing resembling a spark in this film anywhere.\n",
      "Review: Mildly diverting.\n",
      "Review: The Greek gods had outsized powers and petty grievances. These Gen-Y demigods are no different - it's a whole generation of kids with daddy issues\n",
      "Review: A fantasy adventure that fuses Greek mythology to contemporary American places and values. Anyone around 15 (give or take a couple of years) will thrill to the visual spectacle\n",
      "Review: Remember the first time you saw Harry Potter on the big screen? This is more like the third time you saw him but with bigger effects and Greek mythology replacing the occult.\n",
      "Review: Built with set pieces that demonstrate a real affection for Greek myth iconography and centered on a strong performance by Logan Lerman (a star in the making), Percy Jackson & The Olympians aims young and hits the target fairly consistently.\n",
      "Review: Not without bright moments ... but the story is centered around a trio of young actors who simply aren't operating at the same skill level as their older costars.\n",
      "Review: While winning the award for longest movie title, it is a film that only goes through the motions.\n",
      "Review: Harry Potter meets Clash of the Titans … The backdrop of Greek mythology makes an enjoyable change of pace from the medieval fantasy magic of the Potter stories.\n",
      "Review: Percy Jackson is simply uninspired in every single meaning of the word. It's probably the crassest, most obviously derivative work of this sort since Eragon.\n",
      "Review: A clunky kid-sized epic, able to conjure colossal acts of Greek myth wonderment, but never brave enough to shut its pie hole and let the audience process the screen magic.\n",
      "Review: It kind of just builds up to a lot of Not Much.\n",
      "Review: Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief proves to be a satisfying beginning to what is sure to be a promising film franchise.\n",
      "Review: click to read full review\n",
      "Review: Young viewers probably will be entertained but even they are likely to realize that this could have and should have been better, especially by the time they're old enough to drive.\n",
      "Review: While this flick may not have Harry Potter's complex world and multiple layers, it also doesn't have the angst and darkness. It replaces them with one thing in bulk: Fun.\n",
      "Review: Another attempted launch of a teen-aimed franchise, but this show-boat is rowing through the motions. Seen-that, been-there fantasy-epic stuff with dialogue more wooden and hollow than the Trojan Horse.\n",
      "Review: A fun, effects-filled, escapist adventure, with several clever notions: Medusa sells garden statuary as a cover, and the Parthenon in Nashville is home to a hydra.\n",
      "Review: It's all jolly good fun, rattling along at a perfect pace with enough action setpieces and spectacle to keep both youngsters and adults happy.\n",
      "Review: It looks like the characters of color in Percy Jackson have been paired off, a remarkable choice in a movie that is, in essence, about the glories of half-breeds.\n",
      "Review: A safe, bland, test-marketed product made for tween mass consumption. Like most films arriving with ampersands and colons in the title, it's a bore.\n",
      "Review: The whole thing is piffle, but it moves fast enough to stay entertaining.\n",
      "Review: A great family film, with just the right measures of action, mythological allusions, humor, and adventure.\n",
      "Review: What surprised me is that I had some affection for an action adventure film the way I would have in the days of the Ray Harryhausen's best films.\n",
      "Review: Not a perfect film, but the movie does have a certain passion that a lot of other franchise attempts have lacked. If you like Greek mythology and are looking for an antidote to Clash of the Titans, this may be what you're looking for.\n",
      "Review: The plot uses the presence of the Greek gods as an indistinct outline to influence teenagers who are more interested in the prestige and glamor of their connection than the responsibility that comes with it.\n",
      "Review: Just another mediocre fantasy flick, but if you enjoyed the books, I'm sure you'll enjoy the film.\n",
      "Review: An enjoyable PG-rated family adventure in its own right, but Columbus' film can't live up to the Potter gold standard, and it strays enough from Riordan's source material to make its tween readership blow a gasket every few minutes. [Blu-ray]\n",
      "Review: Manages to pay its respects to the Greek myths and actually convey them as fun.\n",
      "Review: Sorry Mr. Jackson, but Harry Potter you ain't.\n",
      "Review: ... a sprightly Harry Potter clone and an eye-candy-coated intro to Greek mythology.\n",
      "Review: The pleasant surprise is how deftly the story translates the myths from their classical idiom into modern ones and without losing the classical flavor\n",
      "Review: Director Columbus never quite gets comfortable juggling the film's myriad characters, grandiose-but-stale CGI effects, and PG-friendly battle scenes, speeding headlong through endless plot points rather than taking the time to make any of them matter.\n",
      "Review: ...an agreeable fantasy adventure that should leave fans of the genre satisfied.\n",
      "Review: A dull, scattershot affair that owes much to both X-Men and Greek mythology but which never seems to slow down enough to make any sense whatsoever.\n",
      "Review: Some moments of inspired silliness save this escapist adventure from complete dullness.\n",
      "Review: This film is replete with plot holes.\n",
      "Review: Lerman has a presence even with a mouth full of bad dialogue.\n",
      "Review: Columbus and company have crafted an agreeable mythological jaunt the whole family will enjoy, and while I wouldn't pay more than matinee prices that still means making the quest to the multiplex is a journey worthy of the undertaking.\n",
      "Review: There are lots of cool surprises along the way, and the special effects are fantastic, especially the ones that create Uma Thurman's Medusa snakedo.\n",
      "Review: Unfortunately, the movie lacks that good old Potter charm, trading Harry's dark whimsy for a handful of CGI magic beans.\n",
      "Review: It's apparent that Potter may at last have a worthy successor.\n",
      "Review: Like its stars, the film is genial good company.\n",
      "Review: All you have at the end of it is an enervating feeling of deja vu.\n",
      "Review: While it certainly isn't terrible, it plays like a low-rent variation of the Harry Potter formula--innocuous but instantly forgettable.\n",
      "Review: This is a kids' movie: Parents can either get into the silly-suspenseful spirit of it or play Rummikub on their iPhones.\n",
      "Review: ...great fun for the whole family. And if it introduces you and any young readers in your home to the books, so much the better.\n",
      "Review: This is what a quality book adaptation should do, stand on it's own, while making you want to explore more. But JESUS! Can we stop the Apple Product Placements! I don't want to see a freaking iPhone in a Fantasy film!!!\n",
      "Review: Despite so much epic drama in Greek mythology from which to borrow, here we are given little sense of the magnitude of the clash between the quarrelsome gods...\n",
      "Review: Likable as Percy may be, it's not lightning he's stolen.\n",
      "Review: \"It is a bit hard to see quite where Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief's market lies. Too adult for juveniles, too juvenile for adults.\n",
      "Review: It would be an easy slam review. But if you like big pretty toy commercials, it's plenty of fun.\n",
      "Review: It's not awful. It's just not particularly inspired. Something tells me this movie won't be inspiring a sequel anytime soon.\n",
      "Review: Too scary for younger fans of the popular book.\n",
      "Review: Columbus knows his way around this kind of material even if some of the special effects look like they came from Deep Discount.\n",
      "Review: Has all the CGI sorcery of a Harry Potter pic, but none of the magic.\n",
      "Review: Director Chris Columbus has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the film's dippier moments. It's his most enjoyable effort since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n",
      "Review: The camera work is frequently pedestrian, the acting is bland, and the jokes often fall flat.\n",
      "Review: Dutifully Potteresque it begins, and dutifully Potteresque it ends.\n",
      "Review: My problems with it are the same as with most screen adaptations of young adult novels...they spend so much time struggling to explain the world they're creating that they forget which parts of the story people want to see...they figure that people (kids)\n",
      "Review: Whew boy.\n",
      "Review: Percy Jackson, you are no Harry Potter. You are not fit to walk in a hobbit's wake.\n",
      "Review: Parental Content Review\n",
      "Review: Harry, Ron and Hermione: Relax. You could whip Percy Jackson and his pals with your wand hands tied behind your backs.\n",
      "Review: The film toggles between high camp and deadly earnestness, all the while threatening to drown in an ocean of not-so-special effects.\n",
      "Review: Sadly worthy of its dumping into the cinematic boneyard of wintry mid-February.\n"
